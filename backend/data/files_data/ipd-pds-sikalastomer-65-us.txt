Description
®
IsobutyleneSikaLastomer -65
Isoprene Copolymer Tape is a high
performance, high rubber content
tape designed for superior webbing
and quick-flow resistance properties.
This product demonstrates superior
surface
tack
which
remains
permanently elastic and is designed
®
to bond through oily GALVALUME ,
®
KYNAR 500 , aluminized steel,
®
ZINCALUME , galvanized metal,
aluminum, siliconized polyester and
polyvinyl fluoride painted metals,
glass,
wood,
concrete,
fiberreinforced plastics, FRP and similar

substrates. Its superior surface tack
affords tenacious adhesion to these
substrates without pre-wiping the
surface even at temperatures as low
as -5°F. It is designed for higher
tensile
strength
and
webbing/elongation
requirements
encountered in standing seam
endlaps in metal construction.
Where superior tensile strength and
extensibility
(webbing/elongation)
are critical in both hot and cold
climates use Isobutylene-Isoprene
Copolymer Tape rather than general
purpose butyl tapes. It will remain
soft and pliable at temperatures as
low as -5°F to facilitate roof panel

®

assembly.
SikaLastomer
is
formulated without asbestos fillers.
®
SikaLastomer -65
contains a
special additive which inhibits a
broad spectrum of microbial activity.

Product Benefits
- Superior surface tack
- Permanent elasticity
- High tensile strength
- Webbing/Elongation
- Contains additive to inhibit
microbial growth
- Asbestos Free
