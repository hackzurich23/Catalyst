SikaBiresin®AP112
(FORMERLY P-11 TYPE II)
POLYESTER FRP BOND & FILL SYSTEM
THIXOTROPIC / FIBER FILLED
DESCRIPTION

The reinforcing strength of SikaBiresin®AP112 fibrous filler makes it very useful for increased bonding
strength or for rebuilding broken or void areas in SMC, RIM and other thermoset composites.
SikaBiresin®AP112 is a smooth thixotropic paste system which exhibits easy mixing and stable
application qualities. This system has excellent adhesive qualities, can be readily machined, accepts all
types of finishes with "no bleed out", and is considered having low moisture characteristics.
SikaBiresin®AP112 has high impact strength, excellent heat and cold resistance and a very high degree
of chemical resistance. It can be applied in varying degrees of thickness with minimal shrinkage and is
can be used for deeper surface composite repairs before final surfacing with a fairing compound.
Typical bonding applications include: FRP composites to FRP, rebuilding broken areas, metal inserts
to fiberglass, marine fabrication, metal to concrete, detail blocks to FRP, wood to wood bonding and
metal to metal bonding.
Please note: Although the two colored versions (white and green) of this product are catalyzed with
BPO cream hardener, their work life is different.

PROCESSING
PROCESSING CONDITIONS



Thoroughly blend 100 parts resin with 2 parts hardener by weight for 1 to 1 ½ minutes in clean
dry container or on a clean dry surface.
Carefully scrape the surfaces while blending to ensure complete mixing and uniformity.

SURFACE PREPARATION and APPLICATION




The area to be filled or repaired should be thoroughly cleaned, roughened, cleaned again
and dried to allow for the best possible adhesion.
The mixed AP122 should be buttered into the area, avoiding trapping air during application.
After curing to a tack-free state, the material can be sanded and finished as needed.

MIXING INSTRUCTIONS

Stir contents of can thoroughly using a spatula or putty knife. Place the required amount of filler
and cream hardener on a disposable clean surface. Set up time of mix at room temperature will be
5-10 minutes. After 15-30 minutes the filler may be filed or sanded to final finish.

HANDLING PRECAUTIONS

Normal health and safety precautions should be observed when handling these products :
 Ensure good ventilation.
 Wear gloves, glasses and protective clothes.
For further information, please consult the Safety Data Sheets.

STORAGE CONDITIONS
 Product shelf life of polyester resin is 12 months when stored in original unopened containers
between 65 – 77°F (15 – 25°C). Any opened can must be tightly closed. Product shelf life of BPO
hardener is 18 months when stored in original unopened containers between 65 – 77°F (15 – 25°C).
Any opened can must be tightly closed.
 Polyester resin contains filler which has the potential to separate in time, please re-homogenize
prior to use.
