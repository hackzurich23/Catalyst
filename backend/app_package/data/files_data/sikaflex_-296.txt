AREAS OF APPLICATION
Sikaflex®-296 is designed for direct glazing applications in both the OEM and repair Marine
markets. It is suitable for use with all types of
mineral glass-based windows used in Marine.
Before installing laminated safety glasses,
which incorporate heating elements in the PVB
sandwich layer, contact Sika’s Technical Service
Department for advice. Sikaflex®-296 can be
tooled to a very fine finish and is suitable for
exposed joints.
Seek manufacturer’s advice and perform tests
on original substrates before using Sikaflex®296 on materials prone to stress cracking.
Sikaflex®-296 is suitable for experienced professional users only. Test with actual substrates
and conditions have to be performed to ensure
adhesion and material compatibility.

CURE MECHANISM
Sikaflex®-296 cures by reaction with atmospheric moisture. At low temperatures the water content of the air is generally lower and the
curing reaction proceeds somewhat slower (see
diagram 1).

To ensure a uniform thickness of the bondline
it is recommend to apply the adhesive in form
of a triangular bead (see figure 1).

CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
Sikaflex®-296 is generally resistant to fresh water, seawater, diluted acids and diluted caustic
solutions; temporarily resistant to fuels, mineral oils, vegetable and animal fats and oils; not
resistant to organic acids, glycolic alcohol, concentrated mineral acids and caustic solutions or
solvents.
METHOD OF APPLICATION
Surface Preparation
Surfaces must be clean, dry and free from
grease, oil, dust and contaminants.
Surface treatment depends on the specific
nature of the substrates and is crucial for a long
lasting bond. Suggestions for surface preparation may be found on the current edition of the
appropriate Sika® Pre-treatment Chart. Consider that these suggestions are based on experience and have in any case to be verified by
tests on original substrates.
Application
Sikaflex®-296 can be processed at temperatures (climate and product) between 10 °C and
35 °C (50 °C and 95 °F) but changes in reactivity
and application properties have to be considered. The optimum temperature for substrate and sealant is between 15 °C and 25 °C
(59 °F and 77 °F). Consider the viscosity increase at low temperature. For easy application, condition the adhesive at ambient temperature prior to use.
