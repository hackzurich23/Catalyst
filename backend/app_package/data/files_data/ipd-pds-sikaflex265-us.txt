Description
®
Sikaflex -265 is a high-performance,
elastic,
gap-filling,
one-part
polyurethane adhesive that cures on
exposure to atmospheric moisture to
®
form a durable elastomer. Sikaflex 265 is manufactured in accordance
with the ISO 9001/14001 quality
assurance system.

Product Benefits
- One-part formulation
- Excellent working characteristics
- Fast cure time and low odor
- High Green Strength
- Excellent Sag Resistance
- Resistant to aging and weathering
- Solvent and PVC-free

Areas of Application
®
Sikaflex -265 is designed for direct
glazing applications in both OEM
and Aftermarket industries, and is
suitable for use with mineral glassbased
windows.

agents; temporarily resistant to
fuels, mineral oils, vegetable and
animal fats and oils; not resistant to
organic acids, concentrated mineral
acids and caustic solutions, bleach
or solvents. The above information
is offered for general guidance only.
Advice on specific applications will
be given on request.
Method of Application
Surface preparation
Surfaces must be clean, dry and
free from all traces of grease, oil,
wax and dust. Detailed information
®
on the use and application of Sika
adhesion promoters may be found in
the appropriate product data sheet.
The above information is offered for
general guidance only. Advice on
specific applications will be given on
request.
Application
Unipacs: Place sausage in the
application gun and snip off the

configuration

Tooling and finishing
Tooling and finishing must be
carried out within the tack free time
of the adhesive. We recommend the
®
use of Sika -Slick. Other finishing
agents or lubricants must be tested
for suitability/compatibility.
Removal
®
Uncured Sikaflex -265 may be
removed from tools and equipment
®
with Sika Remover-208, mineral
spirits or another suitable solvent.
Once cured, the material can only
be removed mechanically. Hands
and exposed skin should be washed
immediately
using
a
suitable
industrial hand cleaner and water.
Strictly
follow
solvent
manufacturer's instructions for use
and warnings. Do not use solvents
on skin!
Limitations
Do not apply at temperatures below
50°F (10°C) or above 95°F (35°C).
The optimum temperature for
substrate and adhesive is between
59°-77°F (15°-25°C). Approximate
drive-away times for vehicles
following glass installation or
replacement under optimum cure
conditions (23°C / 50% r.h.) are as
follows:
buses
and
trucks
(windshield) 6 hours; rail vehicles 12
hours.

- Do not apply on frozen surfaces or
through standing water or under
water.
- Do not apply over silicones or in
the presence of curing silicones.
- Alcohol inhibits the cure of
®
Sikaflex -265 or any other
polyurethane based material. Do
®
not allow Sikaflex -265 to contact
alcohol and alcohol containing
solvents during cure.
- Do not use to bond organic glass
(i.e. polycarbonate and acrylic).

closure clip. Cut off the tip of the
nozzle to give desired adhesive
bead geometry. For satisfactory
results the adhesive must be applied
with a hand operated cartridge gun,
piston-type
compressed-air
or
battery powered gun. To ensure a
uniform thickness of adhesive bead,
we recommend that the adhesive be
applied in the form of a triangular
bead (see diagram below).
