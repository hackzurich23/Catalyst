AREAS OF APPLICATION
Sikaflex®-221 bonds well to a wide variety of
substrates and is suitable for making permanent elastic seals . Suitable substrate materials
are metals, metal primers and paint coatings
(2-component systems), ceramic materials and
plastics. It is ideally used for internal sealing
and simple bonding applications.
Seek manufacturer’s advice and perform tests
on original substrates before using Sikaflex®221 on materials prone to stress cracking. This
product is suitable for experienced professional
users only.
Test with actual substrates and conditions have
to be performed to ensure adhesion and material compatibility.

CURE MECHANISM
Sikaflex®-221 cures by reaction with atmospheric moisture. At low temperatures the water content of the air is generally lower and the
curing reaction proceeds somewhat slower (see
diagram 1).

Tooling and finishing
Tooling and finishing must be carried out within
the skin time of the sealant. It is recommended
using Sika® Slick. Other finishing agents must
be tested for suitability and compatibility prior
the use.
Removal
Uncured Sikaflex®-221 can be removed from
tools and equipment with Sika® Remover-208
or another suitable solvent. Once cured, the
material can only be removed mechanically.
Hands and exposed skin have to be washed immediately using a suitable industrial hand
cleaner and water.
Do not use solvents on skin.

CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
Sikaflex®-221 is generally resistant to fresh water, seawater, diluted acids and diluted caustic
solutions; temporarily resistant to fuels, mineral oils, vegetable and animal fats and oils; not
resistant to organic acids, glycolic alcohol, concentrated mineral acids and caustic solutions or
solvents.
METHOD OF APPLICATION
Surface Preparation
Surfaces must be clean, dry and free from
grease, oil and dust.
Surface treatment depends on the specific
nature of the substrates and is crucial for a long
lasting bond. Suggestions for surface preparation may be found on the current edition of the
appropriate Sika® Pre-Treatment Chart. Consider that these suggestions are based on experience and have in any case to be verified by
tests on original substrates.
Application
Sikaflex®-221 can be processed between 5 °C
and 40 °C (41 °F and 104 °F) but changes in reactivity and application properties have to be
considered. The optimum temperature for substrate and sealant is between 15 °C and 25 °C
(59 °C and 77 °F).
Sikaflex®-221 can be processed with hand,
pneumatic or electric driven piston guns as well
as pump equipment. For advice on selecting
and setting up a suitable pump system, contact
the System Engineering Department of Sika Industry.

Overpainting
Sikaflex®-221 can be painted after formation of
a skin. If the paint requires a baking process,
best performance is achieved by allowing the
sealant to fully cure first. 1C-PUR and 2C-acrylic
based paints are usually suitable. All paints
have to be tested by carrying preliminary trials
under manufacturing conditions. The elasticity
of paints is usually lower than of sealants what
could lead to cracking of the paint film in the
joint area.
