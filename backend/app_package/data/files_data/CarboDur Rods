PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Sika® CarboDur® Rods are pultruded carbon fiber
reinforced polymer (CFRP) rods designed for
strengthening concrete, timber and masonry structures.
The rods are primarily installed using the Near Surface
Mounted (NSM) technique by inserting into grooves cut
into the substrate and bonded with an epoxy resin. The
rods can also be used for anchoring SikaWrap fabrics for
positive attachment to concrete or masonry.

USES
Sika® CarboDur® Rods may only be used by experienced
professionals.
▪ Negative moment reinforcing in slabs and decks
▪ Anchoring of SikaWrap fabrics
▪ Strengthening of masonry walls
▪ Doweling applications
▪ Cathodic protection applications

Load increases
▪ Increased live loads in warehouses
▪ Increased loading in parking decks
▪ Installation of heavy machinery
▪ Vibrating structures
▪ Changes of building utilization

Damage to structural parts
▪ Aging of construction materials
▪ Steel reinforcement corrosion
▪ Vehicle impact
▪ Fire

Serviceability improvements
▪ Decrease in deformation
▪ Stress reduction in steel reinforcement
▪ Crack width reduction

Change in structural system
▪ Removal of walls or columns.
▪ Removal of slab sections for openings

Design or construction defects
▪ Insufficient reinforcements
▪ Insufficient structural depth

CHARACTERISTICS / ADVANTAGES
▪ Very high strength
▪ Lightweight
▪ Non-corrosive
▪ Very easy to handle
▪ High modulus of elasticity
▪ Can accept traffic on surface (rods are countersunk)
▪ High bond strength due to full encapsulation
▪ Rods are not visible once installed
▪ Outstanding fatigue resistance
▪ Alkali resistant
