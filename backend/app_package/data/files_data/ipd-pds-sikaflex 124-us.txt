Cure Mechanism
®
Sikaflex -124 Mirror Grip cures by
reaction with atmospheric moisture.
At low temperatures the water
content of the air is generally lower
and the reaction proceeds more
slowly. (See Diagram 1)

Limitations
- Do not use directly on polyolefin
(polyethylene/polypropylene)
safety films
- A mechanical support system
must be used during and after
installation
- Avoid contact with alcohol and all
alcohol containing products during
cure
- Test tough-to-bond surfaces
before applying
- Do not use on tar, bituminous or
asphaltic based surfaces
- Due to multiple paint types and
variances in chemistry, it is
recommended to test all painted
®
wall surfaces with Sikaflex -124
Mirror Grip prior to application to
ensure proper performance
- The open time is significantly
shorter in hot and humid climate.
Mirror parts must always be
installed within the open time.
Never install any mirror part after
the product has built a skin
Method of Application
Surface preparation
Clean all surfaces with suitable
solvent prior to application. Joint
walls must be sound, clean, dry,
frost-free, and free of oil and grease.
Curing compound residues and any
other foreign matter must be
thoroughly removed.

Application
Recommended application
temperatures: 40 - 100 °F. For cold
weather
application,
condition
material to 65 - 75 °F before using.
Cut plastic tip of nozzle to desired
size and puncture airtight seal at
base of tip. Force adhesive onto
bonding surface. Apply adhesive as
vertical beads spaced at 8 inches
apart or in 1 - 2 inch circular shaped
patties every square foot. Installer
has approximately 30 minutes to
reposition
an
object

repositioning, the object must not be
removed from the substrate in such
a way that it loses contact with the
bonding surface and breaks the
continuity of the adhesive bead
between the substrate and the
object being bonded. Heavier
substrates may require additional
support during the cure period.
Tooling and finishing
Tooling and finishing must be
carried out within the skin time of the
adhesive. To facilitate tooling, dry
tool with a suitable wooden or metal
spatula. Do not use alcohol or
alcohol-containing
products
for
tooling.
Removal
®
Uncured Sikaflex -124 Mirror Grip
can be removed from tools and
®
equipment with Sika Remover-208
or another suitable solvent. Once
cured, the material can only be
removed mechanically. Hands and
exposed skin should be washed
immediately
using
a
suitable
industrial hand cleaner and water.
Strictly follow solvent manufacturer's
instructions for use and warnings.
Do not use solvents on skin!
